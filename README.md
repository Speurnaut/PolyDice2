![PolyDice 2: A simple dice-rolling app for RPGs](https://github.com/speurnaut/PolyDice2/blob/master/Media/featureimage.png?raw=true)

PolyDice 2 is the hit sequel to PolyDice, one of the dice rolling apps of all time.

PolyDice 2 is a simple dice-rolling app which provides a full set of standard RPG dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100, and a Coin Flip.

Nothing compares to the tactile experience of rolling your own dice, but PolyDice 2 aims to replicate this as close to this as possible with clean art and a simple feature set.

PolyDice 2 is an Android app, created using .NET Maui and C#. All of the art assets were created by myself using Affinity Designer.
