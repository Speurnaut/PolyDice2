PolyDice 2 is the hit sequel to PolyDice, one of _the_ dice rolling apps of all time.

PolyDice 2 is a simple dice-rolling app which provides a full set of standard RPG dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100, and a Coin Flip.

Nothing compares to the tactile experience of rolling your own dice, but PolyDice 2 aims to replicate this as close to this as possible with clean art and a simple feature set.

PolyDice 2 is an Android app, created using .NET Maui and C#. All of the art assets were created by myself using Affinity Designer.

PolyDice 2 is available to download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nic_aplin.polydice2).
